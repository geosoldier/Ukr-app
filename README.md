## 📖 Why Gender Matters
In Ukrainian, every noun belongs to one of three genders:
- **Masculine** → usually end in a **consonant**
- **Feminine** → often end in **-а** or **-я**
- **Neuter** → often end in **-о** or **-е**

Learning gender is essential because it affects adjectives, verbs, and agreement in sentences.
